              AWS Student Community Day Nepal was a remarkable event that
              brought together cloud-enthusiast students and professionals
              across Nepal from all regions. Once again kudos to AWS Cloud Club
              Nepal for this event that empowered students by offering good
              exposure on AWS including travel scholarships. It was an honor to
              be part of this event, contributing in shades of shadow by
              creating challenges for the Capture The Flag(CTF) competition.

              Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing
              platform offered by Amazon. It provides on-demand cloud computing
              services and products to individuals, companies, and governments.
              AWS allows users to rent computing power, storage, and various
              other IT resources, enabling them to scale up or down quickly
              based on their needs.

                cloud, which means you access services over the internet rather
                than relying on physical hardware in your local environment.
